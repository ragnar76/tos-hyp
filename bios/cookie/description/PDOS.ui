!begin_node Cookie, PDOS

(!B)PowerDOS(!b) is a pre-emptive multitasking kernel that replaces GemDOS and 
fixes all the bugs! Extremely efficient kernel based on OS-9 and Unix. 
Features shared memory, semaphores, queues, signals, pipes, pseudo 
TTY's, loadable file systems, loadable device drivers. Doesn't block 
other processes during disk I/O like some other kernels do. Compatible 
with all Atari ST/STe/MSTe/TT/Falcon030. Loadable network file system 
available (commercial) for RS232, MIDI, and LAN. 

Modifies vectors: TRAP #1, TRAP #13, Trap #14, MFP (all).

Status: Shareware.
